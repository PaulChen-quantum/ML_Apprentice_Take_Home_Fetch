        "Scenario 1: Freeze the Entire Network\n",
        "\n",
        "Description: Freeze the encoder and both task-specific heads. No weights are updated during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "When to Use: For debugging, sanity checks, or testing training loops. To evaluate a pretrained model’s embeddings as static features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Drawbacks: Model won’t learn anything task-specific. Likely poor task performance (heads are not adapted).\n",
        "\n",
        "Scenario 2: Freeze Only the Transformer Backbone\n",
        "\n",
        "Description: Encoder (paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2) is frozen. Only the task-specific heads are trainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "When to Use: You have limited labeled data for tasks A and B. You want fast training and avoid catastrophic forgetting. The pretrained embeddings are already semantically meaningful.\n",
        "\n",
        "Trade-off: Lower compute cost. But less task-specific adaptation at the representation level.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scenario 3: Freeze Only One Task-specific Head\n",
        "\n",
        "Description: Example: Freeze task_a_head, only train task_b_head. Encoder may or may not be frozen.\n",
        "\n",
        "When to Use: You want to retain learned performance on one task (A), while adapting the model to a new task (B). Useful in continual learning or transfer learning settings.\n",

        "1.\tStart with paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 pretrained model because\n",
